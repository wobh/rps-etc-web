* About

This is a Rock-Paper-Scissors web game. For now all I have is javascript file which contains the logic of the game.

* Functions

In the console you can run =main= with the following options:

- =main(rps-hands)= :: will play a standard Rock-Paper-Scissors game against a computer player which randomly selects a hand.
- =main(rpsls-hands)= :: will play a Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock game against the computer player which randomly selects a hand.

* TODO
- create web interface
- create cleverer computer options, perhaps the computer could use statistics to guess the next play.
